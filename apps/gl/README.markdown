OpenGL test applications.

The applications here were adapted from open-source demos suites (such as Mesa
demos suite), modified to be non-interactive.

Rather than cover the full breadth of OpenGL functionality, the focus here is
to cover entrypoints that require special hand-written code to be
traced/replayed correctly.
